# RomanNumeralProblem

Ok, this was deceptively tough, mostly because it could go a dozen different directions. I don't have the code actually working currently, but as you were fine with a partial, here you go. The general idea was simple: working with an object oriented language, make an object. I've downloaded Ruby and tried running it, and I've gotten a syntax error of some kind, but being as I'm still fairly new at this, I'm assuming it wouldn't be too hard to wheedle out with the guidance of a book or two. 

The specific tact I chose was to have arrays for the 1 and 5 variations on each place, and simply work through the individual digits of the number with an eye to placement. It was the most elegant of all the ideas that I came up with, as well as the least processor intensive (one idea was literally counting up to your number, modifying the string along the way).

Enjoy,
